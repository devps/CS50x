Que 1.  What’s stdint.h?
Ans:    stdint.h is header file to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width intergers types.

Que 2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans:    Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program, we can fill up exact amount of space we want in a file which is good for things like bitmap headers.

Que 3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans:    BYTE= 1 bytes , DWORD= 4 bytes, LONG= 4 bytes (signed) , WORD= 2 bytes.

Que 4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
Ans:   ASCII: BM (bitmap!)   Hex: 0x424d  , value is stored in "bfType"

Que 5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans:    bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles, while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file. biSize is constant and it equals 40 bytes.

Que 6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans: If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

Que 7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Ans:    biBitCount

Que 8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
ans:  If it can not find the file in both lines.

Que 9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans:    It specify how many elements you want to read, and we're always reading a struct so we only need 1 struct.

Que 10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans: The padding would be 3.

Que 11. What does fseek do?
Ans:  It moves to a specific location in a file.

Que 12. What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans:  It moves file pointer positions to given location.
